# Agent Looker - Claude Code Plugin

A [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) plugin that protects AI agents from unsafe URLs, malicious content, and prompt injection attacks via the [Agent Looker](https://agent-looker.whoscall.com/) MCP server.

## What it does

Agent Looker adds two layers of protection to your Claude Code sessions:

**Hooks (automatic)** -- System-level guards that run without Claude's involvement:

- **PreToolUse** -- Before every `WebFetch`, the URL is checked against threat databases. Unsafe URLs are blocked before Claude ever sees the response.
- **PostToolUse** -- After every `WebFetch` and `WebSearch`, the returned content is scanned for prompt injection, jailbreak attempts, PII leaks, and other risks.

**Skills (Claude-driven)** -- Four skills that teach Claude when and how to call Agent Looker's MCP tools:

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `check-url-safety` | Before accessing any URL (curl, wget, git clone, etc.) | Covers URL access paths that hooks don't intercept |
| `check-text-safety` | When processing external text from any source | Covers content sources beyond WebFetch/WebSearch |
| `report-risk-url` | Proactively, when a suspicious URL is discovered | Phishing, malware, scam, suspicious redirects |
| `report-risk-text` | Proactively, when suspicious text is discovered | Prompt injection, jailbreak, data leaks |

Together, hooks enforce protection on the most common paths (`WebFetch`, `WebSearch`), while skills extend coverage to everything else.

## How protection works

```
WebFetch(url)
      |
      v
PreToolUse hook: web-checker
      |
      +-- check_url_safety --> UNSAFE --> blocked (Claude never fetches)
      |                    --> SAFE   --> allowed
      v
   WebFetch executes
      |
      v
PostToolUse hook: text-checker
      |
      +-- check_text_safety --> BLOCK/FLAG --> Claude warned via additionalContext
                            --> ALLOW     --> pass through
```

A safe URL can still serve malicious content. URL checks and content checks are two independent layers.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) >= 18
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI or VS Code extension
- An Agent Looker account (sign up at the dashboard)

## Installation

### Option A — Let Claude Code install for you

Paste the following prompt directly into your Claude Code agent:

```
Please install the Agent Looker plugin by running these 3 commands in order:

1. Run: claude plugin marketplace add Gogolook-Inc/agent-looker-claude
2. Run: claude plugin install agent-looker
3. Run: node ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/agent-looker-marketplace/bin/setup.mjs
   IMPORTANT: run step 3 with run_in_background: true, then immediately use the Monitor tool on the returned PID to stream its output. When a line containing an authentication URL appears, show it to me and remind me to open it in my browser. Keep monitoring until I confirm I have signed in, then check that the process exited successfully.

After all steps complete, remind me to restart Claude Code to activate the plugin.
```

---

### Option B — CLI (manual)

#### 1. Install the plugin

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add Gogolook-Inc/agent-looker-claude
claude plugin install agent-looker
```

To install a pre-release version, specify the branch:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add Gogolook-Inc/agent-looker-claude@develop
```

#### 2. Authenticate

After installing the plugin, run the setup script to authenticate:

```bash
node ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/agent-looker-marketplace/bin/setup.mjs
```

This will:
1. Open your browser to sign in (or let you paste a token manually)
2. Save your token to the `env` block of `~/.claude/settings.json`
3. Install security rules into `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

#### 3. Restart Claude Code

Then **restart Claude Code** to activate.

### Pointing at another environment (staging / develop)

The plugin defaults to production. The endpoint is a single environment variable, `AGENT_LOOKER_MCP_URL`, which the MCP server config, both hooks, and the setup script all read. To switch, pass it to setup once:

```bash
node ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/agent-looker-marketplace/bin/setup.mjs --mcp-url https://agent-looker-stg.example.com/mcp
```

This stores the override in `~/.claude/settings.json` under `env` and authenticates against that environment. The dashboard and auth URLs are derived from it. Run setup again with the production URL to go back to the default.

You can also set the variable yourself instead of using the flag:

```json
{ "env": { "AGENT_LOOKER_MCP_URL": "https://agent-looker-stg.example.com/mcp" } }
```

## Uninstall

```bash
node ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/agent-looker-claude/bin/setup.mjs --uninstall
```

This removes the Agent Looker entries from `~/.claude/settings.json`, the CLAUDE.md security rules, cached skills, and the plugin.
